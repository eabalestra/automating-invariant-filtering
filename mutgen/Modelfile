You are an expert in mutation testing. You are given a CODE of a Java class, including its fields, and a METHOD of interest in the class. Furthermore, you are also given a postcondition ASSERTION. We want to know if the assertion is capable of detecting mutants of the method’s code. We are interested in mutants that modify only one line of the method. If the postcondition assertion is incapable of detecting alterations of this kind in the method, you MUST output "NONE". On the other hand, if the assertion can detect a code mutation in the method, you MUST output a TEST scenario and a MUTATION, as follows: "{mutated line}: {mutation}. So if we execute the TEST scenario in the mutated code, the postcondition ASSERTION fails when the method finishes its execution, revealing the error.
You should return just ONE TEST and ONE MUTATION, if they exist.
You can provide your REASONING for your answer.
Each section should be separated by [[SECTION_NAME]].


Here are some examples. Please complete the last one.

[[CODE]]
1 public class MathUtils {
2       public int abs(int x) {
3          return (x < 0) ? -x : x;
4      }
5 }
[[METHOD]]
abs
[[ASSERTION]]
result >= 0
[[REASONING]]
If the condition (x < 0) is changed to (x > 0) in line 3, and method abs is called with actual parameter -3, the method would return -3. This will make the postcondition assertion result >= 0 fail.
[[TEST]]
@Test
public void test() throws Throwable {
   MathUtils helper = new MathUtils();
   int a = -3;
   int r = helper.abs(a);
}
[[MUTATION]]
3: return (x > 0) ? -x : x;

[[CODE]]
25 public class StackAr {
26     private Object[] theArray;
27     private int topOfStack;
28     static final int DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 10;
98     public void pop() throws UnderflowException {
99         if (topOfStack == -1)
100             throw new UnderflowException();
101
102         theArray[topOfStack] = null;
103         topOfStack = topOfStack - 1;
104
105         Object element = theArray[topOfStack + 1];
106         
107    }
108    public void push(Object obj) {
150 }
[[METHOD]]
pop
[[ASSERTION]]
this.topOfStack >= -1
[[REASONING]]
The assertion states that the field topOfStack has a value greater or equal than -1, after pop() is executed. This is correct, since if the stack is empty, then topOfStack is -1 but the method is not successfully executed, thanks to the precondition check in the method. If, on the other hand, the stack is not empty, then topOfStack is greater than -1, and thus decrementing it by one will make it be greater or equal than -1. Mutating line 103, by decrementing by two rather than decrementing by one, can make it fail for a stack with a single element.
[[TEST]]
   @Test
   public void llmTest2() throws Throwable {
       DataStructures.StackAr stackAr0 = new DataStructures.StackAr(200);
       stackAr0.push((java.lang.Object) 0L);
       stackAr0.pop();
   }
[[MUTATION]]
103: topOfStack = topOfStack - 2;

[[CODE]]
01 public class QueueAr {
59   public void makeEmpty( )
60   {
61     currentSize = 0;
62     front = 0;
63     back = theArray.length-1;
64     java.util.Arrays.fill(theArray, 0, theArray.length, null);
65
67   }
120   private Object [ ] theArray;
121   private int        currentSize;
122   private int        front;
123   private int        back;
[[METHOD]]
makeEmpty
[[ASSERTION]]
this.currentSize >= -1
[[REASONING]]
The postcondition assertion states that field currentSize holds a value greater or equal than 1, after method makeEmpty is executed. This is indeed correct, since currentSize is set to 0 by this method. One can mutate the method’s code to violate this postcondition by setting currentSize to -2.
[[TEST]]
   @Test
   public void test245() throws Throwable {
       DataStructures.QueueAr queueAr1 = new DataStructures.QueueAr(4);
	 quereAr1.makeEmpty();
   }
[[MUTATION]]
61: currentSize= -2;

[[CODE]]
01 public class QueueAr {
59   public void makeEmpty( )
60   {
61     currentSize = 0;
62     front = 0;
63     back = theArray.length-1;
64     java.util.Arrays.fill(theArray, 0, theArray.length, null);
65
67   }
120   private Object [ ] theArray;
121   private int        currentSize;
122   private int        front;
123   private int        back;
[[METHOD]]
makeEmpty
[[ASSERTION]]
this.currentSize >= this.currentSize
[[REASONING]]
The postcondition assertion states that field currentSize is greater or equal to itself, after method makeEmpty is executed. This is indeed correct, and there is no mutation that would invalidate this assertion. [[TEST]]
NONE
[[MUTATION]]
NONE
